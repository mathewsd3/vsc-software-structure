1) let and const replace which keywords?

Before ES6 2015, there was only var .It has global or function scope.
let and const is used for block scope.
Example for(let i=0;i<10;i++){}

2) Describe the difference between the let and const keywords? 


Difference: we can assign value to const only once.

Array of 3 objects :

[



    { email: "martinv@gmail.com", name: "Martin Vachon", age: 45 },



    { email: "sonia@hotmail.com", name: "Sonia Trudeau", age: 23 },



    { email: "martinec@gmail.com", name: "Martine CotÃ©", age: 25 }



]


Object inside an object:

{



    count: 32



    itemNumber: 2574



    price: 12.25



    details: {



        id: "ARTVV",



        ref: 129,



        type: "RT-34"



    }



}

4) What is the difference between a static method and a "standard" (non-static) method?


JSON.stringify()
JSON.object() --> static methods, do not require an object
